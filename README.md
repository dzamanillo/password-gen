# Password Generator

Internet security is an ever growing concern. With so mush of our lives on the web, it is important to protect it with the use of unique and strong passwords. I hope this application helps keep your web life safe!

My main objective with this application was to take an existing project of mine and introduce a new technology to make it better. I used this opportunity to learn SASS and Materialize CSS. Overall it was a great opportunity to grow as a developer. Links to the project and the original build can be found below.
